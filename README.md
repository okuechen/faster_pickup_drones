# X4: Foundations - Faster Pickup Drones

This mod simply increases the speed of pickup drones a lot, giving them an argon mk3 figher engine. Reason behind this is, that i think they are way to slow and most wares just disappear, before a drone reaches it. Makes it impossible to pirate with larger vessels.
